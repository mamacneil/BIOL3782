# BIOL3782
*Course materials for The Biologist's Toolkit (BIOL 3872): scientific computing for biology in R*

---
Develop fundamental skills for the practical use of computers in biological sciences. The course focuses on computer-related techniques used in day-to-day biological work, covering best practices for scientific computing and data handling, theory of visualisation, and scripting, teaching students how to create, store, and manipulate data using the object-oriented programming language R. Examples and projects will be drawn from a wide variety of biological areas, covering typical problems encountered with computer use. The course is a prerequisite for higher-level quantitative courses in biology.

Assignments are to be developed and submitted within the class JupyterHub framework.


## Academic integrity

Plagiarism, cheating, and other misconduct are serious violations of your contract as a Dalhousie student. You are expected to know and abide by [Dalhousie's policies regarding academic misconduct](https://www.dal.ca/dept/university_secretariat/academic-integrity.html). Violations of these policies will be dealt with according to the Faculty [Discipline Process](https://www.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/dept/university_secretariat/FacultyDisciplineProcedures_Jun2016.pdf).

For this course, plagiarism is defined as code that is identical or eerily similar to that of other students - programmers develop code that reflect their individual styles and these conventions are easily recognised. You are absoutlely encouraged to collaborate and consult online fourms such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), however submitted work must be your own effort, with **sources of borrowed code clearly indicated in script comments**.
