    "R is what is known as an object-oriented statisical programming language. To unpack that a bit:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [**Object-oriented**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) means that, when writing code, specific words are given status as objects - the buliding blocks of data, functions, and operations that act together to achieve an outcome\n",
    " - [**Statistical programming**] - means that R is not intended for general use, but rather is a platform dedicated to the analysis of data, with conventions and associated packages directed to that end. \n",
    " \n",
    "Where there is a core set of libraries (packages of code) in every R installation, R relies hevaily on a set of freely-contributed packages that are created outside of the R core developers, available on their repository website, [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html). There are a lot of them. And of varying quality. However R's success as a programming language for science stems largely from the crowd-sourced nature of CRAN and the ability of clever people who come up with new statistical methods to *easily* integrate them into the R environment. So when using R, one will often see one of the following, used to load up packages of code and make them available for use:\n",
    "\n",
    "``library()``\n",
    "\n",
    "``require()``\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of which, somewhat confusingly, will load the package given within the parentheses. The ``require()`` function is intended for use within other functions, so they will only be available when the function is running.\n",

    "**Good code is elegant.** If you remember one programming axiom through this course, let this be it. However like any style, getting there is not easy. People that dress well know how to do it because they have spent hundreds of hours trying things out and failing. Simplicity and clarity should be your aspirational goals for how your code looks initially; only later, with experience, will you have the wisdom to try daring or wild things out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this important? Beacause well-styled code makes it quick and easy for others - **or more importantly, your future self** - to understand what is going on. Trust me. You will very quickly have no idea what you programed even two weeks ago and if you don't have clean, well documented code (which is easy to do on the fly), you'll want to whip yourself later.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what should our R coding style be? Based on [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) of course! Here you'll find guidelines that will help make your code more readable and I encourage you to follow them closely to learn a few things about what makes for clean code. An example:\n",

    "    total <- sum(x[,1])  # Needs a space after the comma\n",
    "    total <- sum(x[ ,1])  # Needs a space after the comma, not before\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The one recommendation I would make against Google's recommendations is to use underscores ('\\_') rather than periods ('.') for spacing in names (i.e. use my\\_variable rather than my.variable). This is because R is the only language around that lets you use peroids in this way and developing universal methods is better than language-specific ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documenting code is equally important to style, for the obvious 'need to speak to future ignorant self' reasons. In R (and many other languages) we can use a hashtag to add a comment that does not affect how the code runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, how your code looks is up to you, but there will be a style grading portion of your assignments (20\\%!) and if things do not look clean, these marks will be lost forever. "

Given that computers are based on sets of 1's and 0's, these three simple buliding blocks are the basis of a huge amount of what we can do on a computer.\n",

    "Right at the end is a clue - their position summary number is 1. In baseball, player positions are all [given numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_positions), starting with the pitcher (`1`). So both of these chaps are pitchers. Students of the game will also note they are both in the National League (`Lg==NL`), where pitchers are also required to hit (unlike the harder-hitting American League (`AL`), where they are not). One more question then is, given they are pitchers in a league where the must hit, how can they play 60 games with only one at bat? It could be that these players are [closers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)), who are put into the game at the critital end, when their team is leading and they want to preserve a win. In a later lecture we'll figure out how to figure out who they are by accessing still more data."
