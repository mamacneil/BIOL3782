The CMYK colour model assumes light is reflected off the surface of something, and colours are achieved by plotting dots of different sizes (rather than of different intensities). If you have something very specific to print, CMYK is your colour model and will look different on the printed page than on-screen. This is why monitors need to be calibrated to specific printers to get appropriate results. If you ever buy colour printer cartridges you'll recognize these colours (plus black). This is a **subtractive** colour model in that it starts with white, and uses levels of the other colours to subtract percentages of the printed space from white, using the printed colours."

    "\n",
    "There are many, many formats for computer graphics, and knowing a bit about the major ones will help steer you toward what you need for various contexts. The big divide is between **raster** and **vector** graphics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Raster graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster graphics are typical format for computer images, particularly photos that have been captured (and stored) as a grid of coloured squares. Our eye can perceive down to about 0.1 mm, beyond that everything gets smoothed together. The resolution of raster grahpics are typically spefied in units of `dpi` or dots-per-inch, or points. However in all cases they are ways of storing information to tell a computer how to render a mesh of different colours to create an image.\n",

    "gif | Graphics interchange format - 8 bit, lossless compression suitable for things with hard angles (but not high-res)\n",

    "Rather than relying on individually coloured squares of RGB light, vector graphics use mathematics to define the edges of graphical objects, making them independent of resolution constraints. By combining arcs, lines and circles, graphics are built up that remain sharp at any size, and can be passed as a series of objects that can be edited in another program, such as Adobe Illustrator. \n",
