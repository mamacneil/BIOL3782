    "Among the most useful things scripting for a programming language provides is the ability to program out the various steps in an analysis so that, should the underlying data change, you can quickly re-run everything and get a revised result. This utility also extends to plotting, where one script conducts the analysis and a second script re-creates all the plots. Yet this entire process can be taken to its logical conclusion, where code, plots, and text are all intermingled so that figures and any numbers in the text are dynamic, even possibly the text itself. \n",

    "The fourth element comes in various forms -- [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) was an early standout -- but today we're going to look at [R-Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), which is a great reason to use the popular [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com), a GUI-wrapper for R that provides a clean layout that some people prefer. RStudio also fund great people (i.e. [H Wickham](http://hadley.nz)) to contribute a boatload of [useful packages](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/), many of which we've already seen."

    "Computer programmer [Leslie Lamport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport) created LaTeX in the 1980's as a typsetting language that - in stark contrast to the WYSIWYG fussing of Word - separates the design and layout of documents from the writing itself. This [separation of content and presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_content_and_presentation) design philosophy allows you to write stuff quickly without any care as to how it looks until the end (if at all). LaTeX is popular among physicists and statisticians, in part because they're code-savy, but also because LaTeX does an excellent job rendering equations relatively quickly. So well in fact that [Word now accepts LaTeX](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/linear-format-equations-using-unicodemath-and-latex-in-word-2e00618d-b1fd-49d8-8cb4-8d17f25754f8) notation in its (awful) equation editor, and it is available in R-Markdown as well to typeset equations within the text body. \n",
